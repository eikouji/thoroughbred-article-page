        <h2>History of the Thoroughbred</h2>
            <p>The Thoroughbred breed was developed in England during the 17th and 18th centuries by 
            crossbreeding native mares with imported Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman stallions. The 
            resulting breed was known for its speed, agility, and endurance, making it ideal for 
            horse racing.</p>
